Currently about half of the programs error out and the other half either terminate in the way they ought to, or close to it (meaning the output 
may still be erroneous even though it's giving us something).

I figured I'd commit what I have now so you can take a look at it 
or get started with your part of the doc.

I get a weird sort of error where the instruction register somehow starts
to get populated with data from the data cards, which should NOT be happening.

I need to stop for now as I have work in the morning, but I'll pick this up again afterwards.
